<p>Recently I've been invited by the <a href="http://www.cryptool.com/">CrypTool</a> team to contribute to the <a href="http://jcryptool.sourceforge.net/">JCrypTool</a> project. I've been following CryptTool for some time and it is definitely one of the best tools to practice and experiment with cryptography and cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>Looking at the latest JCrypTool version, it is apparent that there are vast design improvements, it is also more modular, which makes the extensibility of the project a very easy task. There are several algorithms to use, symmetric, assymetric, hash, MAC etc. So there are lots of things to play with!</p>

<p>In the Cryptanalysis part of the tool, there is a Columnar Transposition module, Frequency analysis graphs, a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_test">Friedman Test function</a> and a Vigenere analyser/helper, so there is space for additions. Speaking of additions, I particularly like the  <a href="http://jcryptool.wiki.sourceforge.net/ExtensionPointsAndArchitecture">plugins architecture</a> in use, which makes the project very interesting indeed.</p>

<p>In the past, I developed a simple cryptanalysis <a href="http://www.cipher.org.uk/2006/04/04/jipher-v02a/">tool</a> which I am now intending to move into JCrypTool in the form of a plugin and possibly doing the same for a very old <a href="http://www.cipher.org.uk/read/2002/05/10/joystickcrypt/">project</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend you go and have a look at <a href="http://jcryptool.sourceforge.net/JCrypTool/Home.html">it</a><a>.</a></p>
