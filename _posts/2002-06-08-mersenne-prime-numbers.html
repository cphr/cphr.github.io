<p>One of the most famous mathematical problems is Mersenne       prime numbers formula : If for some positive integer       <em>n</em>, 2<em><sup>n</sup></em>-1 is prime, then so is <em>n</em>. At this       point many scientists and programmers are having a race of whome will find       the a number which applies to the formula above and the result will have       more than 10 million digits. Ofcourse, that moment the "winner"       will stay forever in the history of mathematical science but also he/she       will take the money prize which is 100.000 US Dollars. <a href="http://www.eff.org/coop-awards">Follow       this link to learn about the award</a>.</p>

<p>One of the biggest researchers world-wide is the       organisation named after Mersenne. At <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">mersenne.org </a>you can find a tool which by using distributed computing techniques       tries to find the biggest known Mersenne prime and at this point the       biggest has 4 million digits.  The software given by Mersenne.org       called GIMPS and the creator is <strong>George Woltman.</strong></p>
<p>GIMPS requires a Pentium class computer that is on most       of the time. The program runs at the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/faq.htm#priority">lowest       possible priority</a>. You <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/links.htm#studies">should       not see any impact</a> on your system's performance. The program will use       about 8MB of memory and about 10MB of disk space.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you will need a lot of patience.       Roughly speaking it will take about a month to run a single primality test       - visit <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/bench.htm">the benchmark page</a> for a more accurate estimate on your computer.</p>
<p>If you've decided you have a powerful enough computer       and enough patience to stick with the project, then visit the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm">download</a> page for instructions on downloading, installing, and starting the       program.</p>
<p>The program talks to <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/primenet/status.shtml">PrimeNet</a>,       a central server on the Internet, to get work to do and report results.       The program communicates using the HTTP protocol and may require a little       extra configuration to get through some firewalls. The program only sends       a few hundred bytes every week or two. Thus, there is no impact on your       network performance. The program does not require a continuous Internet       connection and if properly configured will not automatically dial out to       establish an Internet connection.</p>
<p>Finding new Mersenne primes       is not likely to be of any immediate practical value. This search is       primarily a recreational pursuit. However, the search for Mersenne primes       has proved useful in development of new algorithms, testing computer       hardware, and interesting young students in math.</p>
