<p>This text intent to help you solve only simple monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic ciphers by giving you the resources you might need .</p>
<p>In my opinion the first thing you should have is a good tool to help you calculate statistics in the ciphertext , therefore I recommend : <a href="http://crank.sourceforge.net/">Crank</a>(linux,windows) and <a href="http://www.cryptool.com/">CAP</a>(windows)<br />
CAP is more sophisticated , but crank is good as well.</p>
<p>Then you need to have a dictionary with many different word lengths , so you can guess words easier ,the best I've found with a categorisation like that is : <a href="http://aaron.doosh.net/lexicon/">Wordox Lexikon</a><br />
To know Letter frequencies in the language your ciphertext is written is very helpfull and is a must.<br />
<em>Note : if you have statistics for other languages please let me know</em></p>
<p>The following is a stats example for the english language,</p>
<p>Letter frequencies starting from the most frequent :<br />
<strong>e ,t ,s ,d ,n ,r ,y</strong><br />
The most common digrams starting from the most frequent :<br />
<strong>th ,he ,at ,st ,an ,in ,ea ,nd ,er ,en ,re ,nt ,to ,es ,on ,ed ,is ,ti</strong><br />
The most common Trigraphs starting from the most frequent :<br />
<strong>the ,and ,tha ,hat ,ent ,ion ,for ,tio ,has ,edt ,tis ,ers ,res ,ter ,con<br />
,ing ,men ,tho</strong><br />
The most common Doubles starting from the most frequent :<br />
<strong>ll ,tt ,ss ,ee ,pp ,oo ,rr ,ff cc ,dd ,nn</strong><br />
The most common words starting from the most frequent :<br />
<strong>the ,of ,are ,I ,and ,you ,a ,can ,to ,he ,her ,that ,in ,was ,is ,has<br />
,it ,him ,his</strong></p>
