<p> Hacking challenge is a new era of MIND PUZZLES that computer people  and not only, like. There are many of them around, some of them  very simple and some of them very tricky.</p>
<p>Some of them exist for years with 1000s of players forming a society of people with related interests and some other are very new formed by friends.</p>
<p>This kind of puzzle is 100% related with security and people who create them  try to cover as many aspects as they can from this tricky area.</p>
<p>Network Security ,Computer Security, Cryptography, Steganography everything  you could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>One of the most famous challenge creator was Fravia and his students , Fravia  and his Reverse Engineering school introduced the reverser's challenge, (http://www.fravia.com), at which people were learning how to reverse engineer applications on real challenges.</p>
<p>Another challenge was the one that Cyberarmy created, in which thousands of  people participated. Using an army hierarchy model, users depended on their ability  to climb up the ranking board. Although cyberarmy isn't just a competition arena ,  the people who created it they had in mind something like a computer cyber society  which have as main role to spread knowledge and help people learn. The famous red library  (http://library.readyresponse.org) created by the Ready Response Team  (http://www.readyresponse.org/). There are several groups in there , like the  special operations group etc.(http://www.cyberarmy.com/)</p>
<p>Another hacking challenge that is very famous is mod-x (mod-x.co.uk) created  by wang. This challenge is also a big society of people trying to compete in  9 levels (at this point and probably more in the future) world. They start from  very easy and they are going up to some level of difficulty.   If you are ready to spend some brain waking hours (and I am talking about hours!) try any of the following and DO NOT CHEAT! :</p>
