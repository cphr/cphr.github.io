<p><a href="http://cipher.org.uk/assets/Jipher.jar">Jipher v0.2a</a> [<a href="http://cipher.org.uk/assets/Jipher.jar">JAR</a>](JDK 1.5) Jipher is a simple cryptanalysis tool that can be used to attack old ciphers. An additional functionality is present to analyse cookies. (Many bugs at the moment so give me a shout if you want something special added or a bug fixed). It is multi-threaded but some delay is introduced if you analyse many cookies. A short tutorial will be added soon to help you use</p>
