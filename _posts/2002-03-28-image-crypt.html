<p><strike><strong>Image Crypt/v0.1-</strong><font color="red">Project on suspense</font></strike> <em>Created with php/GD and additional php/mCrypt. The main idea is to convert text into bits then encrypt it with a cryptographic algorithm (RC4) and create an unrecognisable image with it. You can use it in order to send sensitive information via email or any other internet protocol and make it hard for any intruder/attacker to decode,decrypt and understand the meaning of the image.</em><br />
