<p>Abstract:<br />
The Multimedia Messaging System allows a user of a mobile phone to send messages containing multimedia objects, such as images, audio or video clips. MMS has very quickly gained the popularity of SMS among mobile users. Alongside, the need for a secure communication became more imperative. Hiding information, especially in images has been an attractive solution for secret communication.</p>
<p>In this paper we examine the possibilities for the use of steganography within a multimedia message. The most widely known algorithms for steganography are presented and discussed. Their application in a mobile environment is analyzed and a theoretical evaluation is given.</p>
